## How to access my Project

### My application is deployed in heroku and can be accessed here: https://viskam-app.herokuapp.com/

1. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
2. I am using https://covidtracking.com/api/v1/ api to get data to show in my tracker page.
3. I am using [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) - React Component
4. I deployed my application using Heroku. This [article](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-deploy-your-react-app-to-heroku-aedc28b218ae) helped me in deploying
